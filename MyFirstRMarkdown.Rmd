## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## My code here

```{r, echo=TRUE}
print("Hello world")
```

### Bullet list

- Uno
- Due
- Tre  

## Let's try Python:

```{python, python.reticulate=FALSE}
list1=[.5,2,"uga buga",10]
#print(list1[2])

for i in range(len(list1)):
  print("item",i,"=",list1[i])
  #i=i+1
```
